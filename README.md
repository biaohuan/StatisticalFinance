Using Statistical Methods in Asset Selection and Portfolio Optimization

This repository is aimed at demonstrating the implementation of financial applications of statistical packages in R. The methods demonstrated typically relate to statistical trading and moving average forecast methods, which are largely drawn from Tze Leung Lai and Haipeng Xing's book, "Statistical Models and Methods for Financial Markets", and lectures from Prof. Pawel Polak of Columbia University's Department of Statistics.
